# Timer-circuit
A timer circuit 
This project demonstrates a 555 timer-based auto-cutoff circuit that automatically turns off AC-powered devices (like lights or fans) after a preset time delay. The circuit uses the NE555 IC in monostable mode, where a trigger signal activates the timer, keeping the output high for a fixed duration (adjustable via RC components) before cutting off power. Key components include the 555 timer, a relay module (for AC switching), a potentiometer (for time adjustment), and supporting resistors/capacitors. The delay time can be calculated using T ≈ 1.1 × R × C, allowing customization from seconds to hours. The relay isolates the low-voltage DC timer circuit from the high-voltage AC load, ensuring safety. Ideal for energy-saving applications, workshop tools
